Patriot Browser
===============

Patriot Browser is a fork of the Google Chromium browser to use the Patriot Suite APIs.

With this version of the browser, all of the URLs you visit, as well as all the data that 
you upload to the web, as well as every file you download is automatically posted for
the relevant government agencies to review.

Remember: When you browse the web without the Patriot Browser, you are browing the Web with terrorists!
